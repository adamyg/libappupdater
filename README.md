# libappupdater

<p align="center">Windows application updater library, similar to Sparkle and WinSparke. The library checks for updates from a remote server or file-system, which inturn notifies the user of your apps' update and prompts an optional installation. This process can be executed periodically within your application with limited user interaction.</p>

<p align="center">It is a win32 native stand-alone library without any non-system external dependencies, permitting both GUI and console interaction.<p>
<p align="center">Due to minimal external dependencies supports MSVC 2008+ and OpenWatcom and run on Windows XP or greater.
Other toolchains should be possible with minimal effort.</p>
